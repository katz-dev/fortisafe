## 4. 🔍 Literature Review

### 1. Web Browsing Security

- 75% of phishing attacks exploit browser vulnerabilities (Smith et al., 2020)  
- Real-time alerts and education lacking (Jones & Taylor, 2021)  

### 2. Password Management

- 80% reuse passwords (Kim & Chen, 2022)  
- Adoption barriers include complexity and trust (Nguyen et al., 2021)  

### 3. User-Centric Security

- Usability key to adoption (Brown & Wilson, 2020)  

### 4. Web Extensions Security

- Vulnerabilities include data leaks and permission misuse (Nguyen et al., 2022)
